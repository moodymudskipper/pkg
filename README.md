# pkg

pkgs and repos as R6 objects

## examples

``` r
library(pkg)

# create a new package, by default a temp dir is associated to it
# with `p <- Package$new(".")` you'll be working in your working directory and it
# would fetch the package info from there
p <- Package$new()

# A print method summarizes the object
p
#> <pkg_Package> /var/folders/mp/qvg2y_jx63bgk_s0xxh2zr140000gp/T//RtmpwC6veI/pkg1bb6445c9b57
#> Package: pkg1bb6445c9b57
#> Title: What the Package Does (One Line, Title Case)
#> Version: 0.0.0.9000

# we can edit the description
p$DESCRIPTION$set(Package = "math", Title = "Basic math")

# We can add functions using this idiom and create a function in its own script
# no `p$add` element is actually created! instead `p$R$add.R` is created and populated
p$add <- function(x, y) {x + y}
p$R$add.R
#> <pkg_Script> add.R
#> add <- function(x, y) {
#>   x + y
#> }

# This script might be edited interactively
# p$R$add.R$edit()

# we can add to the script with this idiom
# here again `p$R$add.R$subtract` is not created, but `p$R$add.R` is updated
p$R$add.R$subtract <- function(x, y) {x - y}
p$R$add.R$foo <- letters # we're not limited to functions

#>   x - y
#> }

#>   "m", "n", "o", "p", "q", "r", "s", "t", "u", "v", "w", "x", "y",
#>   "z"
#> )

# if the script doesn't already exist it's created
p$R$other.R$multiply <- function(x, y) {x * y}
p$R$other.R
#> <pkg_Script> other.R
#> multiply <- function(x, y) {
